# Doppler
A Bukkit plugin that integrate third party servers into MineNation

# About
The Doppler system was developed for servers that are not hosted on the MineNation platform. In order to maintain the security of MineNation, the Doppler server was designed to provide a bridge between regular minecraft servers and our database. This allows MineNation to add any third party server without having to worry about them decompiling code to find our database info.

# Setup
To create a third party server it requires a doppler apikey, you can get your doppler apikey in the MineNation lobby using the command /Doppler. Then go download our plugin from the spigotmc page or compile it yourself from this github repository, and start your server. Once the server is started it will generate a config file, and you will have to go into that config file and paste your Doppler apikey. Now you just need to start your server and its done.
